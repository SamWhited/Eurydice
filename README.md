### Channel Mapping
The speaker configuration for the show was a custom 7.1 channel surround sound setup similar to standard 7.1 Surround, but with a few modifications which made it incompatible with standard 5.1 and 7.1 audio.
It comprised of 2 front speakers facing House Center at ~22 degrees from the center line, 2 rear speakers spaced about 10 feet further apart than their front counterparts (also facing House Center), a center channel which was placed between the two rear speakers, two environmental speakers (one for the overworld and one for the underworld) which were placed in the set (one stage right facing directly stage left but inside of a specially curtained entrance that reflected the sound towards the audience, and one stage right concealed inside of a large wooden box). There was also a 2100-watt subwoofer placed beneath the audience.

The channel mapping for the effects is as follows:  
Channel 1 -- Le (Left environmental)  
Channel 2 -- Re (Right environmental)  
Channel 3 -- Lf (Left front)  
Channel 4 -- Rf (Right front)  
Channel 5 -- Lr (Left rear)  
Channel 6 -- Rr (Right rear)  
Channel 7 -- Cr (Center rear)  
Channel 8 -- Lfe (Sub)
